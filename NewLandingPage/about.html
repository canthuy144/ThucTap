              <p>SAPA HOPE CENTER AND HOMESTAY is a volunteer project founded by philanthropist Peter Thuong, providing
                free accommodation and English learning opportunities for disadvantaged children living in Sapa. After
                two campus changes, SAPA HOPE CENTER chose to stick with the Ta Phin land, with the hope of giving
                the children here the opportunity to study and grow the same as many children across the country.

                city,
                with the proceeds will be used to provide food for the children and finish facilities. However, the
                Covid wave
                that took place continuously for two years 2019 and 2020 made the fund mobilization of the center
                difficult,
                the school has not been built completely and there is a lack of living equipments, rooms stay for the
                students.

              <p>In order to motivate their academic energies as well as convey their sincere hearts, ITE had mobilized
                employees,
                partners and philanthropists to contribute to help children on the border of the country. On April 24,
                2021,
                we successfully organized a charity trip to SAPA HOPE CENTER. Here, the staff of the company gave gifts
                to
                support the center which are essential items in daily life such as water purifiers, rice, spices, pans,
                ...
                and small gift bags including candies and milk to students. Seeing the bright faces of the children, we
                have
                more confidence in the future preschools of the country.
                The trip finished with hugs, handshakes and wild flower bouquets from the center's children and
                teachers.

              <p>ITE's volunteer trip #9 has ended satisfactorily, leaving each member with unforgettable feelings.</p>
              <p>The convoy began to depart early in the morning, loaded with decent gifts including clothes
                and books for the children. Over a dozen kilometers of mountain roads, appearing right under
                our noses is the wild and misty Hoang Thu Pho commune, the cold weather makes the scene more
                barren than ever. The convoy continues to go deep into Hoang Thu Pho 2 Primary School, which
                is on a dirt road with a steep and winding slope,
                this is also the usual path to school for the students here.

                still smiling to welcome us. Most of the families here are in a difficult situation,
                but life cannot take away their innocent smiles and precious study efforts.

                In parallel with completing projects at work, ITE always focuses on providing a healthy environment for
                staff. Besides charity activities which are held twice a year, we also organize other activities in
                which football is the most favoured.
              </p>
              <p>Sports activities have created a close bond between employees in the company. This sport
                is held 1 session per week, after work, it not only helps to exercise and relax after a long working
                day,
                but it is also an opportunity for brothers in the company to interact with each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, on special days like the founding day of the company, National Day, ...
                ITE also organizes a Marathon for all employees to participate. These activities have shown the
                concern for both mental and physical life of all employees in the company. At the same time, it has
                created a new playground, healthy entertainment, physical training to create a joyful atmosphere
                throughout the Company,
                helping people to regenerate their labor force and creating a close relationship among everyone.
